Tesla is just months from a total collapse, says hedge-fund manager https://t.co/c9bdsObQID https://t.co/7tfjCSzaqp",http://j.mp/2GkLLQr,0,0,Sat Mar 31 06:32:00 +0000 2018,"Tesla is just months from a total collapse, says hedge-fund manager","Unless Elon Musk “pulls a rabbit out of his hat,” Tesla will be bankrupt within four months, says John Thompson of Vilas Capital Management.

“Companies eventually have to make a profit, and I don’t ever see that happening here,” he told MarketWatch. “This is one of the worst income statements I’ve ever seen and between the story and the financials, the financials will win out in this case.”

Thompson manages $25 million and his Tesla TSLA, +3.24% short is the fund’s biggest position. To be fair, he’s been betting big against Tesla for years, which, of course, means he’s endured some brutal stretches.

Last April, for instance, the stock hit a record high around the $300 mark, and Musk was right there to troll the Tesla bears:

Stormy weather in Shortville ... — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 3, 2017

From that point, the stock continued to break new ground, eventually topping out at $389.61. But despite Tesla’s strong performance in 2017, Thompson’s fund still managed to churn out a 65% gain for the year.

Now, Tesla’s back to where it was when Musk fired off his “Shortville” tweet, and Thompson is confident his bet is about to pay off nicely.

In fact, Thompson says if his prediction comes true, his fund could surge by another 50%. With that in mind, he says he’s investing $500,000 of his own money.

“Tesla, without any doubt, is on the verge of bankruptcy,” he told clients in an email over the weekend. He explained that funding will be hard to come by in the face of problems in delivering the Model 3, declining demand for the Model S and X, extreme valuation and a likely downgrade of its credit rating by Moody’s from B- to CCC.

“As a reality check, Tesla is worth twice as much as Ford [estimate of the enterprise value of both companies], yet Ford F, +2.03% made 6 million cars last year at a $7.6 billion profit while Tesla made 100,000 cars at a $2 billion loss,” Thompson said. “Further, Ford has $12 billion in cash held for ‘a rainy day’ while Tesla will likely run out of money in the next 3 months. I’ve never seen anything so absurd in my career.”

Tesla declined to comment on Thompson’s views.

At last check, Tesla shares were down almost 5% at $290, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% was up triple digits.",2018-03-27 12:46:00,marketwatch.com

The Thursday exit of the president's most trusted aide, coming one day after yet another Cabinet departure, highlights continuing uncertainty among Trump aides and White House staff about who might be the next to go.

Hicks departed the administration on her own terms and was given a gracious goodbye by Trump outside the Oval Office in view of reporters. That stands in stark contrast to the White House treatment of David Shulkin, the Veterans Affairs secretary who was fired amid ethics questions and replaced by a White House physician who has no experience running a bureaucracy or working with veterans.

As Trump allies defended the choice of Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, scrutiny quickly shifted to a number of other Cabinet members facing ethics questions and with strained relationships with the president, as well as a White House chief of staff who has found his influence diminished. Trump aides and outside advisers suggested that other changes weren't imminent, but no one could say how long that would last.

""I'll have to get back to you on that,"" said deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters when asked on Air Force One if Trump now had his ideal Cabinet.

White House officials are apprehensive about Hicks' departure, given her unrivaled position in the president's orbit. Despite her title as communications director, Hicks was more accurately described by White House officials as Trump's right-hand-woman and media gatekeeper, providing needed doses of affirmation to the president and able to deliver bad news to him with few repercussions.

The internal jockeying to replace her — if Trump even chooses to do so — has featured backstabbing and planted news stories that, in turn, bash the leading candidates: Mercedes Schlapp, the White House strategic communications director, and Tony Sayegh, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department.

Many close to the White House, however, expect senior adviser Kellyanne Conway or press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to assume the role, at least temporarily. Sanders has grown close to the president since taking over the press secretary's job after the resignation of Sean Spicer last summer — and has been spending more time in the Oval Office lately.

The job of communications director — which involves developing and executing the administration's long-term messaging strategy — has never been a particularly important one to the president. Aides joke he is his own communications director, who upends carefully laid plans with a tweet or digression.

Trump, never disciplined, has taken to freelancing more of late, as he moves to surround himself with aides less likely to try to rein him in. A speech outside Cleveland on Thursday meant to be about infrastructure instead felt like a campaign rally. And he has broken free of more of the restraints placed upon him by chief of staff John Kelly.

Trump hired John Bolton as national security adviser last week over Kelly's objections and didn't include his chief of staff in the Oval Office meeting in which the job offer was extended. And Kelly, who frequently listens in on the president's calls, was not on the call Trump made from the White House residence earlier this month during which, over staff objections, he congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his re-election.

Though Kelly's job did not appear to be in danger, Trump has mused to outside allies of late about setting a West Wing structure with no chief of staff, reminiscent of his Trump Tower operation.

Aides said controversies around Trump's staff need to hit a certain decibel level to get the president's attention.

In the case of Shulkin, who was found to have inappropriately accepted gifts and travel, his parting came as he was under fire from all corners, including GOP-leaning veterans groups and good-government watchdogs. And Trump himself vented to confidants that the questions surrounding Shulkin undermined his campaign promise to help veterans, according to three White House officials and outside advisers who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

Officials said ethical questions swirling around other Cabinet members are not attracting the attention of the president in the same manner but caution that could change quickly.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson came under scrutiny after reports his agency was spending $31 000 for a new dining set. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has faced questions about $25 000 spent on a soundproof ""privacy booth"" inside his office to prevent eavesdropping on his phone calls and another $9,000 on biometric locks.

White House ethics officials, directed by Kelly, have warned Carson, Pruitt and others that further negative attention could change the dynamic and send them packing. But another Cabinet member, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, may have inadvertently stepped into Trump's line of fire this week.

Trump has been livid at Sessions for months for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, belittling him publicly and privately but not yet moving to dismiss him. But Sessions on Thursday appeared on the cover of Time magazine, Trump's favorite publication.

Trump has been known to boast about his appearances on Time covers — fake ones have been installed at his golf courses — and was angry last year when former chief strategist Steve Bannon appeared on one. One Trump ally said the president has previously said, only half-jokingly, that he should appear on the cover every week.",2018-03-30 20:42:28,news24.com

A Long Island judge who police say repeatedly broke into his neighbor's home to steal her underwear has confessed to snatching panties on multiple occasions, even though he has pleaded not guilty.Still, Suffolk County District Judge Robert Cicale has been removed from the bench and is facing up to 15 years in prison.Cicale was arrested on burglary charges and appeared in court Friday morning.The judge is a married father of three young children, and he is accused of sneaking into a home across the street and stealing the underwear of a 23-year-old woman who lives there with her parents. He reportedly knew the girl from when she worked as an intern at the Islip Town Attorney's Office, when he used to work there.In his confession, he said he stole the underwear upon feeling ""urges."" He admitted that on several occasions, he entered the home, opened her hamper and took underwear.Cicarle was taken into custody after an incident that happened around 9 a.m. Thursday, when the young woman was alone. Prosecutors said she was sleeping but woke up when she heard the door open. She called out, ""Hello?"" and that's when she saw Cicale at the doorway.Authorities say he turned around and ran away, and the victim closed and locked the door and called her mother, who called 911. Responding officers say they saw Cicale walking up to a different house and pretending to knock on the door.They approached him because he matched the description of the person the victim described. They reportedly found several pairs of soiled women's underwear on him, which the victim identified as her own.Cicale has written letter of apology to victim and also provided a written confession.""This is highly disturbing,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Tim Sini said. ""This is an individual who swore to uphold the law. He violated it in a very serious way. The message here from both the Suffolk County Police Department and the Suffolk County District Attorney's office is that no one is above the law, and we'll prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law.""A Nassau County district judge presided over Cicale's case to prevent a conflict of interest. Cicale is expected to receive mental health treatment.""His reputation throughout the court is stellar,"" defense attorney William Wexler said. ""Every judge, every lawyer respects him, and we just have to see how the process plays out.""Wexler went on to say that the judge's wife is standing by her husband through this process.Cicale was ordered held on $50,000. Cicale was ""temporarily relieved of his judicial duties"" and the matter was referred to the state's Court of Appeals to determine whether to suspend the jurist, court system spokesman Lucian Chalfen said.A judge also issued a restraining order that prevents Cicale from contacting the victim and, as a condition of his bail, Cicale will also be required to wear a GPS monitor, Sini said.Neighbors were shocked when they learned of the judge's arrest.""From what I heard, it's a little perverted maybe,"" neighbor William Bloom said. ""And that never makes sense to me.""Cicale is a graduate of St. John's Law School, a former legal aide attorney and a former Islip Town Attorney elected to the District Criminal Court in 2016.""He's a family man, he's always outside playing basketball with his kids,"" neighbor Jay Moceri said. ""He's always jogging. He's always friendly to everybody in the neighborhood.""----------",2018-03-30 09:13:16+00:00,abc7ny.com
